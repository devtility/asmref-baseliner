TODO
------------------------------------
* DONE: support .NET Core and .NET FX
* correct file-system case-sensitivity comparison

* parameter validation


Notes
-----

Report should be capable of being compared across machines
i.e. need to be able to compare based on relative paths, not absolute paths
- should be human-readable (i.e. easy to compare in a text comparison tool) and machine readable (so we can reload the baseline file for comparisons)
